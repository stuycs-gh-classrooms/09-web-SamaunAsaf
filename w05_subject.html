<h2>What is cricket?</h2>
<p>Cricket is the second most watched sport in the world, with 2.5 billon fans in the world. It is a simple game, similar to baseball, where there are two teams consisting of 11 players on each side. Each team has the aim of scoring the most runs (points) and get the other team out as fast as possible (also known as wickets)

<h2>How does Cricket work?</h2>
<p>Cricket as mentioned before consists of two teams with 11 players each. The first innings, one team chooses to bat or bowl (similar to pitching in baseball). The side that is batting wants to score as many runs as possible in the given overs (an over consists of 6 bowling deliveries), the bowling team wants to get out the batting team for as little runs as possible (a batting team has a total of 11 batsmen but 10 wickets as there needs to be 2 people on the pitch). As mentioned before there are different game formats according to the amount of overs that format has. The three main formats played nationally and internationally is T20 (20 overs), ODI (one day international or 50 overs which takes the whole day), and test (unlimited overs until a team declares they want to stop playing or get all out) which usually lasts 5 days long.

<h2>Who are the most influential players?</h2>
<p>
Some of the most influential players in cricket are some of the best players in the world. Just like in soccer there is Messi and Ronaldo who changed how people play the game, there are similar figures in the history of cricket. Widely regarded as the King of Cricket, Virat Kohli is the 2nd highest run scorer of Cricket. He has revolutionized the way players bat as his aggressive batting approach but calm way of thinking has influenced how he plays. 
Another very influential player is MS Dhoni (short for Mahendra Singh Dhoni). Regarded as the best Indian Cricket team captain, he lead team India to a win in every single format of cricket (this includes T20 World Cup, ODI world cup, World Test Championship, Asia Cup, and the Champions Trophy).
