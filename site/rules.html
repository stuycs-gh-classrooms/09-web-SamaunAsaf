      Rules of cricket are pretty simple. Two batsmen must be on the field with 11 fielders from the opposing team. The fielding team sends out bowlers who get 6 balls to try to get a batsmen out. On the other hand, the batsmen uses every over to score as many runs as they possibly can. This keeps going on until the batting team gets all out (10 batsmen out), finishes their overs, or declares. The batting team now fields and the fielding team now bats.
